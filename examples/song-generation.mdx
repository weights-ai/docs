Learn how to create AI-generated songs from lyrics using the Weights API. This guide walks you through the process of transforming your lyrics into complete musical compositions.

## Overview

The Weights API provides powerful song generation capabilities that can turn your lyrics into full musical tracks. You provide the lyrics and a style prompt, and the AI creates the melody, instrumentation, and arrangement to bring your words to life.

## Prerequisites

- A Weights API account with an API key
- Lyrics in English (up to 380 characters)
- A style prompt describing the musical style (up to 590 characters)

## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

First, install the Weights SDK and set up your authentication:

```bash
npm install @weights-ai/sdk
```

```typescript
import Weights from "@weights-ai/sdk";

const client = new Weights({
  bearerToken: "your-api-key-here",
});
```

## Step 2: Prepare Your Lyrics and Prompt

Before generating a song, you need to prepare your lyrics and a style prompt. The API accepts English lyrics up to 600 characters and style prompts up to 300 characters.

### Lyrics Requirements

- **Language**: English only
- **Length**: Maximum 380 characters
- **Content**: Can include verses, choruses, or complete songs
- **Format**: Plain text (no special formatting needed)

### Prompt Requirements

- **Length**: Maximum 590 characters
- **Content**: Describe the musical style, mood, genre, and instrumentation
- **Examples**: "blues, melancholic, raw, lonely bar, heartbreak" or "upbeat pop, electronic, dance, energetic"

### Example Preparation

```typescript
// Example: Prepare lyrics and prompts
const verseLyrics =
  "In the moonlight, shadows dance, Whispering secrets of romance, Every step we take together, Makes this moment last forever";

const bluesPrompt = "blues, melancholic, raw, lonely bar, heartbreak, acoustic guitar, soulful vocals";

const popPrompt = "upbeat pop, electronic, dance, energetic, synthesizers, driving beat";

const rockPrompt = "rock, electric guitar, powerful drums, energetic, stadium anthem";

console.log(`Verse length: ${verseLyrics.length} characters`);
console.log(`Blues prompt length: ${bluesPrompt.length} characters`);
console.log(`Pop prompt length: ${popPrompt.length} characters`);
```

## Step 3: Create Your First Song

Start by creating a song generation job:

```typescript
const songJob = await client.songs.create({
  lyrics: "In the moonlight, shadows dance, Whispering secrets of romance, Every step we take together, Makes this moment last forever",
  prompt: "blues, melancholic, raw, lonely bar, heartbreak, acoustic guitar, soulful vocals",
});

console.log(`Song job created with ID: ${songJob.id}`);
```

### Request Parameters

- **lyrics** (required): Your song lyrics in English (max 380 characters)
- **prompt** (required): Style description for the song (max 590 characters)

## Step 4: Monitor Song Generation

Song generation is asynchronous and can take several minutes. Poll the status to track progress:

```typescript
async function checkSongStatus(jobId) {
  const song = await client.songs.retrieve(jobId);

  if (!song) {
    console.log("Song not found or access denied");
    return null;
  }

  console.log(`Status: ${song.status}`);
  console.log(`Queue Position: ${song.queuePosition || "N/A"}`);
  console.log(`Attempt: ${song.attempt}`);

  switch (song.status) {
    case "QUEUED":
      console.log("Your song is waiting in the queue...");
      break;
    case "PROCESSING":
      console.log("Your song is being generated...");
      break;
    case "SUCCEEDED":
      console.log("Song generated successfully!");
      console.log("Download URL:", song.outputUrl);
      break;
    case "ERRORED":
      console.log("Song generation failed. Please try again.");
      break;
  }

  return song;
}

// Check status every 30 seconds
const song = await checkSongStatus(songJob.id);
```

### Job Statuses

- **QUEUED**: Job is waiting in the processing queue
- **PENDING_WORKER**: Job is assigned to a worker
- **PROCESSING**: Song is being generated
- **SUCCEEDED**: Generation completed successfully
- **ERRORED**: Generation failed
- **CANCELED**: Job was canceled

## Step 5: Retrieve Your Generated Song

Once the status is `SUCCEEDED`, your song is ready for download:

```typescript
if (song.status === "SUCCEEDED") {
  console.log("Your song is ready!");
  console.log("Download URL:", song.outputUrl);
  console.log("Original Lyrics:", song.lyrics);
  console.log("Style Prompt:", song.prompt);
  console.log(
    "Generation Time:",
    new Date(song.endTime) - new Date(song.startTime),
    "ms"
  );

  // You can now download or stream the song
  // The URL will be available for a limited time
}
```

## Step 6: List All Your Songs

View all your previous song generation jobs:

```typescript
const allSongs = await client.songs.list({
  limit: 25,
});

console.log(`You have ${allSongs.songs.length} generated songs:`);

allSongs.songs.forEach((song) => {
  console.log(
    `- ${song.id}: ${song.lyrics.substring(0, 50)}... (${song.status})`
  );
  console.log(`  Style: ${song.prompt}`);
  if (song.status === "SUCCEEDED" && song.outputUrl) {
    console.log(`  Download: ${song.outputUrl}`);
  }
});
```

## Advanced Song Generation

### Different Musical Styles

Experiment with various style prompts for different musical genres:

```typescript
// Generate a blues song
const bluesSong = await client.songs.create({
  lyrics: "Walking through the city lights, Feeling free on summer nights",
  prompt: "blues, melancholic, raw, lonely bar, heartbreak, acoustic guitar, soulful vocals",
});

// Generate a pop song
const popSong = await client.songs.create({
  lyrics: "Hold me close, don't let go, In your arms, I feel whole",
  prompt: "upbeat pop, electronic, dance, energetic, synthesizers, driving beat, catchy melody",
});

// Generate a rock song
const rockSong = await client.songs.create({
  lyrics: "Electric dreams and neon lights, Rock and roll through endless nights",
  prompt: "rock, electric guitar, powerful drums, energetic, stadium anthem, distorted riffs",
});

// Generate a jazz song
const jazzSong = await client.songs.create({
  lyrics: "Smooth as silk, the night unfolds, Stories that the moonlight told",
  prompt: "jazz, smooth, sophisticated, piano, saxophone, lounge, intimate atmosphere",
});
```

### Search Your Songs

You can search through your generated songs:

```typescript
const searchResults = await client.songs.list({
  search: "moonlight",
  limit: 10,
});

console.log(
  `Found ${searchResults.songs.length} songs containing "moonlight":`
);

searchResults.songs.forEach((song) => {
  console.log(`- ${song.lyrics}`);
  console.log(`  Style: ${song.prompt}`);
});
```

  } else {
    console.log("An error occurred:", error.message);
  }
}
```

## Complete Example

Here's a complete example that creates a song and waits for completion:

```typescript
import Weights from "@weights-ai/sdk";

const client = new Weights({
  bearerToken: "your-api-key-here",
});

async function generateSong(lyrics, prompt) {
  try {
    // Validate lyrics length
    if (lyrics.length > 380) {
      console.log("Lyrics too long. Maximum 380 characters allowed.");
      return;
    }

    // Validate prompt length
    if (prompt.length > 590) {
      console.log("Prompt too long. Maximum 590 characters allowed.");
      return;
    }

    // Create the song generation job
    console.log("Creating song generation job...");
    const job = await client.songs.create({
      lyrics: lyrics,
      prompt: prompt,
    });

    console.log(`Job created with ID: ${job.id}`);

    // Poll for completion
    let completed = false;
    while (!completed) {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 30000)); // Wait 30 seconds

      const status = await client.songs.retrieve(job.id);
      console.log(`Status: ${status.status}`);

      if (status.status === "SUCCEEDED") {
        console.log("Song generated successfully!");
        console.log("Download URL:", status.outputUrl);
        console.log("Original Lyrics:", status.lyrics);
        console.log("Style Prompt:", status.prompt);
        completed = true;
      } else if (status.status === "ERRORED") {
        console.log("Song generation failed");
        completed = true;
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error.message);
  }
}

// Generate different types of songs
generateSong(
  "In the moonlight, shadows dance, Whispering secrets of romance, Every step we take together, Makes this moment last forever",
  "blues, melancholic, raw, lonely bar, heartbreak, acoustic guitar, soulful vocals"
);

generateSong(
  "Hold me close, don't let go, In your arms, I feel whole, Every heartbeat, every breath, You're my love, my life, my rest",
  "upbeat pop, electronic, dance, energetic, synthesizers, driving beat, catchy melody"
);
```
