Learn how to create AI-generated videos from images using the Weights API. This guide walks you through the process of transforming static images into dynamic video content.

## Overview

The Weights API provides video generation capabilities that can animate static images. You provide an input image and a prompt describing the desired motion, and the API creates a video that brings your image to life.

## Prerequisites

- A Weights API account with an API key
- An image file uploaded to a web-accessible URL
- Basic knowledge of HTTP requests and JSON
- The Weights SDK installed (optional but recommended)

## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

First, install the Weights SDK and set up your authentication:

```bash
npm install @weights-ai/sdk
```

```typescript
import Weights from "@weights-ai/sdk";

const client = new Weights({
  bearerToken: "your-api-key-here",
});
```

## Step 2: Prepare Your Input Image

Before creating a video, you need to upload your image to a web-accessible location. The API requires a publicly accessible URL for the input image.

### Image Requirements

- **Format**: Common image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- **Size**: Recommended resolution for best results
- **Accessibility**: Must be accessible via HTTP/HTTPS URL
- **Content**: Clear, high-quality images work best

### Example Image Upload

```typescript
// Example: Upload to a cloud storage service
// This is just an example - you'll need to implement your own upload logic
async function uploadImage(imageFile) {
  // Upload to your preferred service (AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.)
  const imageUrl = await uploadToCloudStorage(imageFile);
  return imageUrl;
}

const inputImageUrl = await uploadImage("path/to/your/image.jpg");
console.log("Image uploaded to:", inputImageUrl);
```

## Step 3: Create Your First Video

Start by creating a video generation job:

```typescript
const videoJob = await client.videos.create({
  prompt: "Gentle swaying motion with flowing movement",
  inputImageUrl: "https://example.com/your-image.jpg",
});

console.log(`Video job created with ID: ${videoJob.id}`);
```

### Request Parameters

- **prompt** (required): Description of the motion you want to apply to the image
- **inputImageUrl** (required): URL of the input image to animate

## Step 4: Monitor Video Generation

Video generation is asynchronous and typically takes longer than image generation. Poll the status to track progress:

```typescript
async function checkVideoStatus(jobId) {
  const job = await client.videos.retrieve(jobId);

  console.log(`Status: ${job.status}`);

  switch (job.status) {
    case "QUEUED":
      console.log("Your video job is waiting in the queue...");
      break;
    case "PROCESSING":
      console.log("Your video is being generated...");
      break;
    case "SUCCEEDED":
      console.log("Video generated successfully!");
      console.log("Download URL:", job.outputUrl);
      break;
    case "ERRORED":
      console.log("Video generation failed. Please try again.");
      break;
  }

  return job;
}

// Check status every 30 seconds (videos take longer than images)
const job = await checkVideoStatus(videoJob.id);
```

### Job Statuses

- **QUEUED**: Job is waiting in the processing queue
- **PENDING_WORKER**: Job is assigned to a worker
- **PROCESSING**: Video is being generated
- **SUCCEEDED**: Generation completed successfully
- **ERRORED**: Generation failed
- **CANCELED**: Job was canceled

## Step 5: Retrieve Your Generated Video

Once the status is `SUCCEEDED`, your video is ready for download:

```typescript
if (job.status === "SUCCEEDED") {
  console.log("Your video is ready!");
  console.log("Download URL:", job.outputUrl);

  // You can now download or stream the video
  // The URL will be available for a limited time
}
```

## Advanced Video Generation

### Different Motion Types

Experiment with various motion prompts:

```typescript
// Gentle movement
const gentleVideo = await client.videos.create({
  prompt: "Subtle breathing motion with soft waves",
  inputImageUrl: "https://example.com/portrait.jpg",
});

// Dynamic movement
const dynamicVideo = await client.videos.create({
  prompt: "Fast spinning motion with dramatic effects",
  inputImageUrl: "https://example.com/landscape.jpg",
});

// Natural movement
const naturalVideo = await client.videos.create({
  prompt: "Natural swaying like wind through trees",
  inputImageUrl: "https://example.com/forest.jpg",
});
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Motion Prompts

- **Be specific**: "Gentle left-to-right swaying motion" vs "movement"
- **Describe the type of motion**: "swaying", "spinning", "floating", "breathing"
- **Include speed**: "slow", "fast", "gentle", "dramatic"
- **Mention natural elements**: "like wind", "like water", "like fire"

### Image Selection Tips

- **High quality**: Use clear, high-resolution images
- **Good composition**: Images with clear subjects work better
- **Appropriate content**: Some image types animate better than others
- **Avoid busy backgrounds**: Simple backgrounds often produce better results

### Error Handling

```typescript
try {
  const videoJob = await client.videos.create({
    prompt: "Your motion prompt",
    inputImageUrl: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (error.code === "BAD_REQUEST") {
    console.log("Invalid prompt or image URL");
  } else if (error.code === "UNAUTHORIZED") {
    console.log("Please check your API key");
  } else {
    console.log("An error occurred:", error.message);
  }
}
```

## Complete Example

Here's a complete example that creates a video and waits for completion:

```typescript
import Weights from "@weights-ai/sdk";

const client = new Weights({
  bearerToken: "your-api-key-here",
});

async function generateVideo(imageUrl, motionPrompt) {
  try {
    // Create the video generation job
    console.log("Creating video generation job...");
    const job = await client.videos.create({
      prompt: motionPrompt,
      inputImageUrl: imageUrl,
    });

    console.log(`Job created with ID: ${job.id}`);

    // Poll for completion
    let completed = false;
    while (!completed) {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 30000)); // Wait 30 seconds

      const status = await client.videos.retrieve(job.id);
      if(!status){
        throw new Error("Video status not found");
      }
      console.log(`Status: ${status.status}`);

      if (status.status === "SUCCEEDED") {
        console.log("Video generated successfully!");
        console.log("Download URL:", status.outputUrl);
        completed = true;
      } else if (status.status === "ERRORED") {
        console.log("Video generation failed");
        completed = true;
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error.message);
  }
}

// Generate a video
generateVideo(
  "https://example.com/your-image.jpg",
  "Gentle breathing motion with soft pulsing"
);
```

## Use Cases

### Content Creation

- **Social Media**: Create engaging animated content for platforms like Instagram, TikTok
- **Marketing**: Animate product images for promotional materials
- **Art**: Bring static artwork to life with motion

### Creative Projects

- **Portraits**: Add subtle movement to portrait photography
- **Landscapes**: Animate nature scenes with wind or water effects
- **Abstract Art**: Create dynamic abstract animations

## Performance Considerations

- **Processing Time**: Video generation typically takes 5-15 minutes
- **Queue Position**: Jobs are processed in order, so expect some wait time
- **File Size**: Generated videos are optimized for web delivery
- **URL Expiration**: Download URLs have limited availability
